# ZeroDoor

A script written lazily for generating reverse shell backdoors on the go whenever you need without any hassle for your daily penetration needs .
These backdoors are not james bond high tech stuff but rather simple ones to prevent over exploitation and limited capabilities 
Once you generate the payload somehow execute on the conecrened system eithe Win or nix based systems  .
Once executed you will have the capability of executing remote commands on the compromised host :) 
Happy Hacking :D
